# Material Variants Addon for Blender 4.2
I've made this addon for making material variants easy to use. Aren't you tired of changing materials one by one or tired of making spaghetti nodes to changing your shaders? Here is the solution!

With this addon, you can create as much variant options as you want. Then, select each object, asign a material to each option and let the magic happen. When you select an option on the dropdown, all the objects will change to the attached texture.

I think this will make your life a lil bit easier. I've made some of the code with Copilot, I didn't have neither the time or the instructions to make it myself, so it will likely have some bugs and performance issues. You can edit the code if you want, any help is welcomed ^^
